        what to think about when writing unit tests
        </h3>
          <li>
        - What's your input?
        <ul>
          <li>
            - What will happen if any of the parameters:
            <ul>
              <li>- Is null</li>
              <li>- Is mismatch</li>
              <li>- Of different type</li>
              <li>- Of invalid size (length)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        - What's your logic?
        <ul>
          <li>- Can some other code modify your input?</li>
          <li>- Which other code waits for your output?</li>
          <li>- What will happen if you output null?</li>
          <li>
            - What will happen if your code doesn't provide its output on time?
          </li>
          <li>- Does your logic have all possible outputs defined?</li>
          <li>- Are all branches still relevant?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        - Do you interact with data?
        <ul>
          <li>
            - Do you CRUD data?
            <ul>
              <li>- What will happen if you lose rights to CRUD?</li>
              <li>
                -What will happen if the data is missing?
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    - Can you distinguish between no access and no or corrupted
                    data?
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        - Do you loop?
        <ul>
          <li>- Are you sure you'll always exit the loop</li>
          <li>- Are you sure you need to loop?</li>
          <li>- Do you exit quickly on error?</li>
          <li>- Do you not enter the loop if it's not necessary?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        - Does the control flow runs smoothly or you make unnecessary calls?
      </li>
    </ul>
